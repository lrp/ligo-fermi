                <p>
		  We are pleased to announce the second joint LIGO-Fermi workshop at Caltech in
		  Pasadena, CA, March 14th & 15th.
		</p><p>
		  The focus of the workshop will be on topics of joint interest to both
		  collaborations, including science enabled from coincident GRB/GW events
		  and electromagnetic follow-up.  Our hope is to encourage collaboration
		  in a hands-on, interactive way.  For this second meeting, we will
		  include participation and presentations from Swift team members
		  to allow a broader discussion of high-energy electromagnetic
		  observations to GW candidates.


		<h3>Location</h3>
		<a href='./Caltech_Map.pdf'>Campus Map</a>
		<p>
		The workshop will be held on the
		<a href='http://www.caltech.edu/'>Caltech</a> campus,
		in the Keck Laboratory, room 142.  See the
		<a href='./Caltech_Map.pdf'>campus map</a>
		for help finding the buidling.
		</p><p>
		Small group meetings may take place at the outdoor tables near the 
		Red Door Cafe (marked on map).
		</p><p>
		
		<h3>Food</h3>
		Coffee will be provided during breaks.  Lunch is "on your own".  We suggest walking 
		2 blocks west of campus to Lake Ave (see map).  The corner of Del Mar and Lake has many
		choices.  

		<h3>Transportation</h3>
		<b>Parking</b> in <a href='http://parking.caltech.edu/Parking/Visitor'>campus lots</a> 
		in commuter (unreserved) spaces is free on the weekends.
		<br/><br/>
		Getting around Pasadena without a car is challenging, but possible.  From LAX, take the 
		"Flyaway bus" to union station, and then take the Metro gold line to Pasadena.
		Super Shuttle and taxi services are also available.

		<h3>Lodging</h3>
		We have reserved a block of rooms at the Pasadena Hilton
		(where the LVC meeting is taking place) for interested participants.

		<h3>Tentative Meeting Program</h3>
		<h4>Saturday</h4>

11:00 - 12:00 Discussion: Potential astrophysics projects that could enhance joint Fermi-LIGO science (moderators - Jonah Kanner &amp; Larry Price)
<ul>
    <li>This is meant as a discussion session. If you have a slide or two on the following topics please let the organizers know (we have two people/topics below to start the ideas flowing): Characterization of joint signatures - what do detections tell us, e.g., energetics, lightcurves signature of circumburst density? What science can we do with different numbers of detections? Magnetar model of GRBs - what are the predictions for GW? Big questions in astrophysics - what can GW tell us about GRBs?, Population modeling, Binary merger simulations, Constraining total energy in GRBs through beaming - jet breaks? Beaming/collimation of short GRBs.
    <li>High energy precursors from crust-cracking (Jordan Camp)
    <li>GBM-Swift short GRB populations (Eric Burns)
