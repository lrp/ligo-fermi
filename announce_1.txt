We are pleased to announce the second joint LIGO-Fermi workshop at Caltech in 
Pasadena, CA, March 14th & 15th. 

The focus of the workshop will be on topics of joint interest to both 
collaborations, including science enabled from coincident GRB/GW events
and electromagnetic follow-up.  Our hope is to encourage collaboration
in a hands-on, interactive way.  Please see the conference 
website for more details as they become available:

Space is limited. Please contact Larry Price (larryp@caltech.edu) 
or Jonah Kanner (jkanner@caltech.edu) to indicate your interest in attending.
We have reserved a block of rooms at the Pasadena Hilton 
(where the LVC meeting is taking place) for interested participants.
